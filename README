This program is to cluster photos by their timestamps.

(This program is only tested in Linux enviroment with some application
dependencies..)

With the feature mentioned in the referenced paper, the clustering problem
became a boundary classification problem. If the feature of a photo is large,
the photo is likely to be the first one in an event.

There are several binary executable and scripts.

* show will plot the data by timestamp.
* process will plot the feature (novelty score) of the given data.
* parse will take a directory name as input and output the formatted data to
  stdout.
* validate will take SVM parameters C and gamma as input, cross validate 4
  groups of data in data directory and output the number of mis-labeled photos.
* tune will run validate with different C and gamma and output the result to
  output/log. The we can get the best pair of C and gamma from the sorted
  result.
* train and test are by their names--training and testing data set.

In data directory there is parsed data from my cell phone--1516 photos. The
original data is divided to four train-test group. All the data is labeled
according to iPhone's photo moments.

In model directory there is a trained model from data/data_origin with
C = 1000 and gamma = 0.00001, which was the best parameter from tuning output.


!! Please note when labeling data, leave the very beginning photo as 0 though it
is the first photo of the first event.
